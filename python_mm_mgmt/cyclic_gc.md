- Cyclic garbage collection in Python is designed to handle the cleanup of objects that reference each other, forming a cycle, which cannot be handled by simple reference counting alone.

- Here's a more detailed look into how cyclic garbage collection works:

## Why Cyclic Garbage Collection is Necessary
- Reference counting is straightforward but falls short when dealing with cycles. Consider two objects that reference each other:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

a = Node(1)
b = Node(2)
a.next = b
b.next = a
```

- In this example, a references b and b references a.
- If both a and b go out of scope, they should be collected, but their reference counts never drop to zero because they reference each other.
- Cyclic garbage collection solves this problem.

### Generational Garbage Collection

- Python’s cyclic garbage collector is generational, which means it divides objects into three generations based on their lifespan:
  - Generation 0 (youngest): Newly created objects.
  - Generation 1: Objects that have survived one garbage collection cycle.
  - Generation 2 (oldest): Objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles.
- Objects are promoted to older generations if they survive garbage collections.
- Younger generations are collected more frequently than older ones because young objects are more likely to be garbage.

### Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm

- Python uses the mark-and-sweep algorithm to detect and collect cyclic garbage.
- The process consists of two main phases: marking and sweeping.

1. Marking Phase

- In the marking phase, the garbage collector traverses all objects and marks those that are reachable from the root objects (global variables, stack frames, etc.).
- Reachable objects are considered live and are marked as such.

- Here’s a high-level overview of the marking phase:
  - `Roots Identification`: Identify the root objects that are directly accessible (e.g., global variables, local variables in the current call stack).
  - `Marking Reachable Objects`: Traverse the object graph starting from the root objects, marking each reachable object. This traversal can use techniques like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

2. Sweeping Phase

- In the sweeping phase, the garbage collector scans all objects again.
- Unmarked objects are considered unreachable and are thus garbage.
- These objects are then deallocated.

- Here’s a high-level overview of the sweeping phase:
  - `Sweep Unmarked Objects`: Traverse all allocated objects and deallocate those that are not marked as reachable.

### Triggering Garbage Collection

- Garbage collection is triggered automatically based on certain thresholds, but it can also be manually controlled using the gc module.
- The automatic trigger is based on the number of allocations and deallocations.
- `When the difference between allocations and deallocations exceeds a threshold for a generation, a garbage collection is triggered for that generation.`

#### Collection Thresholds
- The thresholds for each generation can be retrieved and set using the gc module:

```
import gc

# Get the current thresholds
print(gc.get_threshold())

# Set new thresholds
gc.set_threshold(700, 10, 10)
```

- The gc.set_threshold(threshold0, threshold1, threshold2) function allows you to control how frequently garbage collection occurs for each generation.
- This can be useful for optimizing the performance of your application by adjusting the balance between garbage collection overhead and memory usage.
