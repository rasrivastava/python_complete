- AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) is a framework used in network security to manage and control access to resources.

- Each component of AAA serves a distinct function to ensure that only authorized users can access and use network resources.

- Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each component:

### Authentication

- `Purpose`:
   - `Verify Identity`: Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a user, device, or system. It ensures that the entity requesting access is who it claims to be.
How It Works:

   - `Credentials`: Authentication typically involves checking credentials such as usernames and passwords, biometric data (e.g., fingerprints), or cryptographic tokens.

- `Methods`: Common authentication methods include password-based authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- `Example`: When you log into a website, you enter your username and password. The system checks these credentials against its database to verify your identity.

### Authorization

- `Purpose`:

Determine Access Levels: Authorization determines what resources or actions an authenticated user is allowed to access or perform. It specifies permissions and access rights.

- How It Works:

- `Access Control Lists (ACLs)`: ACLs define which users or systems have permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions.

- `Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)`: Users are assigned roles with specific permissions. For example, an admin role may have broader access than a regular user role.


### Accounting

- `Purpose`:
  - `Track and Record Activities`: Accounting (or auditing) involves tracking and recording user activities and resource usage. It helps in monitoring and analyzing how resources are being used.

- `How It Works`:
   - `Logs and Records`: Systems generate logs and records of user activities, such as login times, resource access, and changes made.

- `Analysis`: This data can be analyzed to ensure compliance with policies, detect unusual behavior, or troubleshoot issues.

### Example: Online Banking:

- `Authentication`: **Customers log in using a username and password**.
- `Authorization`: **Once logged in, customers can only access their own accounts and perform transactions they are authorized to.**
- `Accounting`: **The bank tracks transactions, login attempts, and other activities for security and compliance purposes.**
