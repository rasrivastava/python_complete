Control Groups

- cgroups (abbreviated from control groups) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes. 

- Cgroups is a feature that enables:
  - `Resource limiting`: groups can be set to not exceed a given memory limit;
  - `Prioritization`: some groups may have a larger share of CPU utilization;
  - `Accounting`: groupâ€™s resource consumption can be measured;
  - `Control`: groups can be frozen and restarted.
